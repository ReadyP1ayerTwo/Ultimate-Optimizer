you MUST extract the "!Auto-Maintainer" folder inside of the zip folder to your desktop.

Run using either the Fast cleaner or the Deep cleaner shortcut, Otherwise the cleaner may not clean all of your files.

The deep cleaner will take longer, But it will find any potentially corrupted files in your system.
